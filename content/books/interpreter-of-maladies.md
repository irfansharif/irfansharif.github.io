Each short story here is a brief snapshot of persons I've known back home, of
persons I now know having moved out west, and persons I'm likely to know going
forward. They're fleshed out, relatable, and deftly written. I really liked
Mrs. Sen's, it reminded me of my own parents and the desolation they felt
uprooting their lives and starting their lives in Dubai. It's not a voice I've
found written much about.
