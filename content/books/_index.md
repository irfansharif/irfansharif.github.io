I promise I'll stop reading these soon, I'm just curious what it's like "on the
other side". Staying on-brand, a lot of this reading was motivated by this
sense of
[inherent](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1302665825883750406)
[distrust](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1339303823865733122) I'm
apparently cultivating.

Worth just skipping to the last third of the book, where it's more speculative
and interesting (and closer to her writing [elsewhere](https://nadiaeghbal.com)).

Picked this up after reading [this

on Haruki Murakami. Will have to read more of
him, it's too good.

Will probably pick up the rest of these series soon, especially Dune. These
are all sci-fi/fantasy, and as far as world-building goes, pretty stellar.

On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft

Mostly autobiographical but also a fun foray into what an "expert" POV in a
domain I have no idea about (popular fiction writing) is like. Also picked up
an actual book of his, which was meh.

The author was unwell writing this. I couldn't actually finish it because of
how gratuitous and grotesque it was. Only went as far as I did out of spite
[(don't ask)](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1257336582627082252), but
had to spoil it for myself to get me to stop.

The lack of punctuation can take some time getting used to, but the characters
are painted colorfully enough for you to tell who's who. For the duration that
it's still ambiguous, it's in keeping with the theme of the book.
