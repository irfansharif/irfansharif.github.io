I promise I'll stop reading these soon, I'm just curious what it's like 'on the
other side'. Staying on-brand, a lot of this reading was motivated by this
sense of [inherent](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1302665825883750406) [distrust](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1339303823865733122)

On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft

Mostly autobiographical but also a fun foray into what an 'expert' POV in a
domain I have no idea about (popular fiction writing) is like. Also picked up
an actual book of his, which was meh.

The author was unwell writing this. I couldn't actually finish it because of
how gratuitous and grotesque it was. Only went as far as I did out of spite
[(don't ask)](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm/status/1257336582627082252), but
had to spoil it for myself to get me to stop.

are painted colorfully enough for you to tell who's who. For the duration that
it's still ambiguous, it's in keeping with the theme of the book.
