Worth just skipping to the last third of the book, where it's more speculative

Picked this up after reading [this

him, it's too good.

Will probably pick up the rest of these series soon, especially Dune. These
are all sci-fi/fantasy, and as far as world-building goes, pretty stellar.

The author was unwell writing this; couldn't actually finish it because of how
gratuitous and grotesque it was. Only went as far as I did out of spite (don't
ask), but had to spoil it for myself to get me to stop.

are painted colorfully enough for you to tell who's who. For the duration that
it's still ambiguous, it's in keeping with the theme of the book.
