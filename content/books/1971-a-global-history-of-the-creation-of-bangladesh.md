This maps out the global political landscape leading up to the 1971
conflict between East and West Pakistan that led to the formation of Bangladesh.
Very little of it is focused on the on-ground experience (which is what I was
originally looking for), but it still made for a decent read. I hadn't really
read up on Bangladeshi history prior, and like with most things there's
a lot of reading you can do, but this covers the broad strokes of the formation
of the [_Awami League_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League),
imprisonment of [_Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman) after having
drafted
the [_autonomy plan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_point_movement),
[_Operation Search Light_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight),
the [_liberation war_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War)
the [_Indian
intervention_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971) that
followed.

It's pretty thorough, so can be a bit dry at times (probably not uncommon for
the genre), but if you're looking for a overview of what happened, one that
isn't impassioned, this does the job. The _global view_ taken here is kind of
interesting; everything is placed in the context of the Cold War and the
inter-relations between China, Soviet Russia, USA, Pakistan and India, with
shifting alliances on the subject of Bangladesh. I also enjoyed learning about
how the declaration of statehood was approached: the Awami league curried
favors among activists all over to raise the question of Bangladeshi
sovereignty, focusing on advocacy abroad to get nation-states to recognize the
declaration.
