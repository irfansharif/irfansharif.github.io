Dune's a very enjoyable cross-over between sci-fi and high-fantasy. It borrows
heavily from Islamic eschatology and Arabic, which informs much of language
used in the book. As far as world-building goes, it was pretty stellar -- I was
hooked throughout. I see myself getting into the rest of the series.
