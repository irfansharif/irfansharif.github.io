A very prescient essay. Baldwin has a way with words, and here he
dissects the very petulant infantility (is that a word?) of non-Black American
consciousness. I liked this bit below, it's aged well:

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
Something very sinister happens to the people of a country when they
begin to distrust their own reactions as deeply as they do here, and
become as joyless as they have become. It is this individual uncertainty
on the part of white American men and women, this inability to renew
themselves at the fountain of their own lives, that makes the
discussion, let alone elucidation, of any conundrum—that is, any
reality—so supremely difficult. The person who distrusts himself has no
touchstone for reality—for this touchstone can be only oneself. Such a
person interposes between himself and reality nothing less than a
labyrinth of attitudes. And these attitudes, furthermore, though the
person is usually unaware of it (is unaware of so much!), are historical
and public attitudes. They do not relate to the present any more than
they relate to the person.
