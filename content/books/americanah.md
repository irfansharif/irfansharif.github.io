I really enjoyed this book. It captures so many peculiarities of all things
North America through the lens of a university student coming in as an
outsider (which paralleled my experiences here). The author is also very
precise in her use of language, and I kept finding myself surprised at her
descriptions of regular interactions I wouldn't otherwise pay much mind to. It
was all very attentive; I really recommend it. She has this [TED
talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story/)
up that explains her narrative style.
