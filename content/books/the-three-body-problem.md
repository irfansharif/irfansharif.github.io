It has a few interesting ideas in there and the blending of the narrative with
the Chinese Cultural Revolution was pretty interesting, but as far as the story
telling aspects of the book are concerned, I was left a bit wanting. The
characters felt two-dimensional and unrelatable (probably intentional
given they're primarily cold, calculating scientists, but still), and the
fiction felt _too_ fantastical? The author does state elsewhere the kind of
sci-fi he prefers is not necessarily one that tries to make passing references
to present-day maladies (and I'm inclined to agree), but this still wasn't my
cup of tea.

That said, I was pretty curious about what Chinese sci-fi looked like and I was
told this was an accessible starting point, which it was. I also hear the
second book in the series is better, so I'll try it.
