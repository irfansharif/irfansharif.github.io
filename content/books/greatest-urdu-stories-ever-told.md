I picked this book u after coming across this [New Yorker
article](https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/read/the-greatest-urdu-stories-ever-told-is-a-belated-introduction-to-a-thrilling-canon).
It's a collection of stories from the pre-partition era, and reminded of folk
tales I heard from my grandparents growing up. I particularly liked "Aanandi",
but the entire set had a compelling range I've not found in other anthologies.
It also had writing from Saadat Hasan Manto, who I've been meaning to read, so
made for a nice surprise.
