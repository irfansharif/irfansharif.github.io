This book maps out the global political landscape leading up to the 1971
conflict between east/west Pakistan that led to the formation of Bangladesh.
Very little of it is focused on the on-ground experience (which is what I was
originally looking for), but it still made for a decent read. I hadn't really
read up on Bangladeshi history prior, and like with most things there's
a lot one can do, but this covers the broad strokes of the formation
of the [Awami League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League),
imprisonment of [Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman) after having draft
the [autonomy plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_point_movement),
[Operation Search Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight),
the [liberation war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War)
the [Indian
intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971) that
followed.

It's pretty thorough, so can be a bit dry at times (probably not uncommon for
the genre), but if you're looking for a overview of what happened, one that
isn't impassioned, this does the job. The "global view" taken here is kind of
interesting; everything is placed in the context of the Cold War and the
inter-relations between China, Soviet Russia, USA, Pakistan and India, with
shifting alliances on the subject of Bangladesh. I also found it interesting
how the declaration of statehood was approached: the Awami league curried
favors among activists all over to raise the question of Bangladeshi
sovereignty, focusing on advocacy abroad to get nation-states to recognize the
declaration.
