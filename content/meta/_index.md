I'm still trying to figure out the kind of writing I want to publish here.
Roughly what I'm thinking is 'notes on engineering for my younger self', where
that could be as recent as six months ago. I have two brothers who are also
in software (they have no personalities of their own, like all younger
siblings); I'm thinking a lot of my writing will be directed at them? If that
sounds like something you'd want in your inbox, [let me know](/newsletter).

Here's my (work-in-progress) digital [bookshelf](/books).
