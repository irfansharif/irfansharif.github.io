I'm still figuring out the kind of writing I want to put here.
Roughly what I'm thinking is _notes on engineering for younger selves,_ where
that could be as recent as six months ago. I have brothers who are also
in software _(lacking personalities of their own, like all younger
siblings),_ so I think a lot of my writing might be directed at them? We'll see,
but if that sounds like something you'd want in your inbox, [let me
know](/newsletter).

Here's my (work-in-progress) [bookshelf](/books), and my [home page](/).
