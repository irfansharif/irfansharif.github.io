I work on on the transactional key-value layer backing
[CRDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach). 
I've also interned here before, working on storage performance and query
execution engines. Previous to that I was at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)
working on ML infrastructure, at [Amazon](https://amazon.com) working on search
relevance, and at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) as a production engineer.
Separately, while at [Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), I tried my hand at
research studying SAT solvers and then speculative consensus protocols. Nothing
really came of either so I gave up.

I'm still trying to figure out the kind of writing I want to publish here. Roughly
what I'm thinking is "notes on engineering for my younger self", where younger
could be as recent as six months ago. I have two brothers,
[Ridwan](https://ridwanmsharif.github.io/) and
[Jishan](https://github.com/jishansharif), and because they have no
personalities of their own (like all younger siblings), also study software.
I'm guessing a lot of my writing will be directed at them. If that sounds like
something you'd want in your inbox, sign up [here](/newsletter).

I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm), and reachable via
[e-mail](mailto:irfan@irfansharif.io).
