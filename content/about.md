I'm an engineer on the distributed key-value store underlying
[CRDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach). I've interned here twice
before, working on storage performance and our query execution engine. Previous
to that I was at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) working on their ML
infrastructure _(tensorflow but built in-house, because why not)_, at
[Amazon](https://amazon.com) working on search relevance _(string matching, but
demonstrably worse)_, and at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) as a production
engineer _(some run-of-the-mill infrastructure work)_. Separately, while at
[Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), I tried a few research stints studying SAT
solvers and then speculative consensus protocols. Nothing really came of
either so I gave up.

I'm reachable through
