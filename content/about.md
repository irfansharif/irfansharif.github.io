## About.

I'm an engineer on the distributed key-value store underlying
[CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach). I've intern here twice
before, working on storage performance and our query execution engine. Other
than that I've interned at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) working on their ML
infrastructure _(tensorflow, but built in-house because reasons)_, at
[Amazon](https://amazon.com) working on search relevance _(string matching, but
worse)_, and at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) as a production engineer
_(run-of-the-mill infrastructure work, nothing to write home about)._

Between all that, during my time at [Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), I tried a
bit of research studying SAT solvers and speculative consensus protocols at.
Nothing really came of either so I gave up.

I'm reachable via [twitter](https://twitter.com/irfansharifm) or
[e-mail](mailto:irfan@irfansharif.io).
