## About.

I work on the distributed key-value sub-system within
[cockroachdb/cockroach](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/), and
probably what I'm going to be talking about here for some time. Previously I was at
at LinkedIn (working on their ML infrastructure), Amazon (search relevance),
and Shopify (regular production engineering). I did a bit of research
into SAT solvers and speculative consensus protocols at Waterloo, but
nothing really came of either.
