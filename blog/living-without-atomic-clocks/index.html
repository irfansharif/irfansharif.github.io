<p>One of the more inspired facets of Spanner<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:spanner"><a href="#fn:spanner">1</a></sup> comes from its use of atomic
clocks to give participating nodes really accurate wall time synchronization.
The designers of Spanner call this
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency"><em>TrueTime</em></a>,
and it provides a tight bound on clock offset between any two nodes in the
system. This lets them do pretty nifty things! We&rsquo;ll elaborate on a few of
these below, but chief among them is their ability to leverage tightly
synchronized clocks to provide a high level of external consistency (we&rsquo;ll
explain what this is too).</p>

<p>Seeing as how CockroachDB<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:crdb"><a href="#fn:crdb">2</a></sup> (abbrev. <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev>) is supposedly
the <em>open source Spanner</em>, for folks even remotely familiar with Spanner
internals a reasonable ask at this point is something along the lines of <em>&lsquo;you
can&rsquo;t be using atomic clocks if you’re building an open source system, so how
does <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> even work?&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good question, and one we (try) to elaborate on here. As a
Spanner-derived system, our challenges lie in providing similar guarantees of
external consistency without having these magical clocks at hand. <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> was
intended to be run on off-the-shelf commodity hardware, on any arbitrary
collection of nodes. It&rsquo;s <em>cloud neutral</em> in that it can very well span
multiple public and/or private clouds using your flavor-of-the-month
virtualization layer. It&rsquo;d be a showstopper to require an external dependency
on specialized hardware for clock synchronization.</p>

<p>So what does <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> do instead? Well, before answering that question,
let&rsquo;s dig a little deeper into why TrueTime was conceived for Spanner in the
first place.</p>

<h2 id="1-time-in-distributed-systems">1. Time in Distributed Systems</h2>

<p>Time is a fickle thing. For readers unfamiliar with the complexities around
time in distributed systems research, the thing to know about it all is this:
each node in the system maintains its own view of time, usually powered by its
own on-chip clock device. This clock device is rarely ever going to be
perfectly in sync with other nodes in the system, and as such, there’s no
<em>absolute</em> time to refer to.</p>

<p>Existentialism aside, perfectly synchronized clocks are a holy grail of sorts
for distributed systems research. They provide, in essence, a means to
absolutely order events, regardless of which node an event originated at. This
can be especially useful when performance is at stake, allowing subsets of
nodes to make forward progress without regard to the rest of the cluster
(seeing as every other node is seeing the same <em>absolute</em> time), while still
maintaining global ordering guarantees. Our favorite Turing award winner has
written a few words on the subject<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:sync-clocks"><a href="#fn:sync-clocks">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="2-linearizability">2. Linearizability</h2>

<p>By contrast, systems without perfectly synchronized clocks (read: every system)
that wish to establish a complete global ordering must communicate with a
single source of time on every operation. This was the motivation behind the
<em>timestamp oracle</em> as used by Google&rsquo;s Percolator<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:percolator"><a href="#fn:percolator">4</a></sup>. A system which
orders transactions \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) in the order \([T_1, T_2]\)
provided that \(T_2\) starts after \(T_1\) finishes, regardless of
observer, provides for the strongest guarantee of consistency called <em>external
consistency</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:extern-consistency"><a href="#fn:extern-consistency">5</a></sup>. To confuse things
further, this is what folks interchangeably refer to as <em>linearizability</em> or
<em>strict serializability</em>. Andrei has more words on this soup of consistency
models <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/consistency-model/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3-serializability">3. Serializability</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s follow one more tangent and introduce the concept of <em>serializability</em>.
Most database developers are familiar with serializability as the highest
isolation level provided by the <abbrev>ANSI SQL</abbrev> standard. It guarantees that the
constituent reads and writes within a transaction occur as though that
transaction were given exclusive access to the database for the length of its
execution, guaranteeing that no transactions interfere with each other. In
other words, no concurrent transaction \(T_2\) is able to read any
partially-written state of transaction \(T_1\) or perform writes
causing transaction \(T_1\) to read different values for the same key
over the course of its execution.</p>

<p>In a non-distributed database, serializability implies linearizability for
transactions because a single node has a monotonically increasing clock (or
should, anyway!). If transaction \(T_1\) is committed before starting
transaction \(T_2\), then transaction \(T_2\) can only
commit at a later time.</p>

<p>In a distributed database, things can get dicey. It&rsquo;s easy to see how the
ordering of causally-related transactions can be violated if nodes in the
system have unsynchronized clocks. Assume there are two nodes, \(N_1\) and
\(N_2\), and two transactions, \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), committing at
\(N_1\) and \(N_2\) respectively. Because we’re not consulting a single,
global source of time \(t\), transactions use the node-local clocks to generate
commit timestamps \(ts\). To illustrate the trickiness around this stuff,
let&rsquo;s say \(N_1\) has an accurate one but \(N_2\) has a clock lagging by
\(100ms\). We start with \(T_1\), addressing \(N_1\), which is able to
commit at \(ts = 150ms\). An external observer sees \(T_1\) commit
and consequently starts \(T_2\), addressing \(N_2\),
\(50ms\) later (at \(t = 200ms\)). Since \(T_2\)
is annotated using the timestamp retrieved from \(N_2\)’s lagging
clock, it commits <em>in the past</em>, at \(ts = 100ms\).  Now, any
observer reading keys across \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) will see
the reversed ordering, \(T_2\)&rsquo;s writes (at \(ts = 100ms\))
will appear to have happened before \(T_1\)&rsquo;s (at \(ts =
150ms\)), despite the opposite being true. ¡No bueno! (Note that this can only
happen when the two transactions access a disjoint set of keys.)</p>

  Figure 1. Causally related transactions committing out of order due to
  unsynchronized clocks.
</span></p>

<p>The anomaly described here, and shown in the figure above, is something we call
<em>causal reverse</em>. While Spanner provides linearizability, <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> only goes as far
as to claim serializability, though with some features to help bridge the gap
in practice. I’ll (lazily) defer to Andrei again, he really does cover a lot of
ground <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/consistency-model/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-how-does-truetime-provide-linearizability">4. How does TrueTime provide linearizability?</h2>

<p>So, back to Spanner and TrueTime. It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that TrueTime
does not guarantee perfectly synchronized clocks. Rather, TrueTime gives an
upper bound for clock offsets between nodes in a cluster. The use of
synchronized atomic clocks is what helps minimize the upper bound. In Spanner&rsquo;s
case, Google mentions an upper bound of 7ms. That&rsquo;s pretty tight; by contrast,
using <abbrev><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a></abbrev> for clock
synchronization is likely to give somewhere between 100ms and 250ms.</p>

<p>So how does Spanner use TrueTime to provide linearizability given that there
are still inaccuracies between clocks? It&rsquo;s actually surprisingly simple. It
waits. Before a node is allowed to report that a transaction has committed, it
must wait 7ms. Because all clocks in the system are within 7ms of each other,
waiting 7ms means that no subsequent transaction may commit at an earlier
timestamp, even if the earlier transaction was committed on a node with a clock
which was fast by the maximum 7ms. Pretty clever.</p>

<p>Careful readers will observe that the whole <em>wait out the uncertainty</em> idea is
not predicated on having atomic clocks lying around. One could very well wait
out the maximum clock offset in any system and achieve linearizability. It
would of course be impractical to have to eat <abbrev>NTP</abbrev> offsets on every write,
though perhaps recent research<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:huygens"><a href="#fn:huygens">6</a></sup> in this area may help bring that down
to under a millisecond.</p>

<p>Fun fact: early <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> had a hidden <em>&ndash;linearizable</em> switch that would do
essentially the above, so theoretically, if you <em>did</em> have atomic clocks lying
around (or generally an acceptable maximum clock offset), you&rsquo;d get
Spanner-like behavior out of the box. We&rsquo;ve since removed it given how
under-tested it was, but perhaps it would make sense to resurrect it as cloud
providers trend towards exposing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-the-amazon-time-sync-service/">TrueTime-like</a>
APIs. Chip-scale atomic clocks are a reality; putting one on server
motherboards would beat the pants off a quartz crystal oscillator.</p>

<h2 id="5-how-important-is-linearizability">5. How important is linearizability?</h2>

<p>Stronger guarantees are a good thing, but some are more useful than others. The
possibility of reordering commit timestamps for causally related transactions
is likely a marginal problem in practice. What could happen is that examining
the database at a historical timestamp might yield paradoxical situations where
transaction \(T_1\) is not yet visible while transaction \(
T_2\) is, even though transaction \(T_1\) is known to have preceded
\(T_2\), as they&rsquo;re causally related.  However, this can only happen
if (a) there&rsquo;s no overlap between the keys read or written during the
transactions, and (b) there&rsquo;s an external low-latency communication channel
between clients that could potentially impact activity on the database.</p>

<p>For situations where reordering could be problematic, <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> makes use of
a <em>causality token</em>, which is just the maximum timestamp encountered during a
transaction. It&rsquo;s passed from one actor to the next in a causal chain, and
serves as a minimum timestamp for successive transactions to guarantee that
each has a properly ordered commit timestamp. Of course, this mechanism doesn&rsquo;t
properly order independent causal chains, though imagining a use case where
that&rsquo;s a problem requires creativity.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s a more critical use for TrueTime than ordering transactions. When
starting a transaction reading data from multiple nodes, a timestamp must be
chosen which is guaranteed to be at least as large as the highest commit time
across all nodes. If that&rsquo;s not true, then the new transaction might fail to
read already-committed data – an unacceptable breach of consistency. With
TrueTime at your disposal, the solution is easy; simply choose the current
TrueTime. Since every already-committed transaction must have committed at
least 7ms ago, the current node&rsquo;s wall clock must have a time greater than or
equal to the most recently committed transaction. Wow, that&rsquo;s easy and
efficient. So what does <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> do?</p>

<h2 id="6-how-does-cockroachdb-choose-transaction-timestamps">6. How does CockroachDB choose transaction timestamps?</h2>

<p>The short answer? Something not as easy and not as efficient. The longer answer
is that <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> discovers an appropriate timestamp for the transaction as
it proceeds, sometimes restarting it at a later timestamp if needed.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the timestamp we choose for the transaction must be
greater than or equal to the maximum commit timestamp across all nodes we
intend to read from. If we knew the nodes which would be read from in advance,
we could send a parallel request for the maximum timestamp from each and use
the latest. But this is a bit clumsy, since <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> was designed to support
conversational <abbrev>SQL</abbrev> where the read/write sets are indeterminate, we <em>can’t</em> know
the nodes in advance. It&rsquo;s also inefficient because we would have to wait for
the slowest node to respond before even starting execution. Aside: readers may
be interested in Calvin<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:calvin"><a href="#fn:calvin">7</a></sup> and <abbrev>SLOG</abbrev><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:slog"><a href="#fn:slog">8</a></sup>, a family of research systems
developed around declaring read/write sets upfront (though giving up
conversational <abbrev>SQL</abbrev>) which consequently manages to avoid this class of problems.</p>

<p>What <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> does instead is actually surprisingly similar to what Spanner
does, though with much looser clock synchronization requirements. Put simply:</p>

<p><blockquote>
    <p>
      <em>While Spanner always waits after writes, CockroachDB
      sometimes waits before reads.</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote></p>

<p>When <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> starts a transaction, it chooses a provisional commit
timestamp based on the current node&rsquo;s wall time. It also establishes an upper
bound on the selected wall time by adding the maximum clock offset for the
cluster. This time interval, \([\ \mathit{commit\ ts},  \mathit{commit\ ts} +
\mathit{max\ clock\ offset}\ ]\), represents the window of uncertainty.</p>

<p>As the transaction reads data from various nodes, it proceeds without
difficulty so long as it doesn&rsquo;t encounter a key written within this interval.
If the transaction encounters a value at a timestamp below its provisional
commit timestamp, it trivially observes the value during reads and overwrites
the value at the higher timestamp during writes. It&rsquo;s only when a value is
observed to be within the uncertainty interval that <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev>-specific
machinery kicks in. The central issue here is that given the clock offsets, we
can&rsquo;t say for certain whether the encountered value was committed <em>before</em> our
transaction started. In such cases, we simply make it so by performing an
<em>uncertainty restart</em>, bumping the provisional commit timestamp just above the
timestamp encountered. Crucially, the upper bound of the uncertainty interval
does not change on restart, so the window of uncertainty shrinks. Transactions
reading constantly updated data from many nodes may be forced to restart
multiple times, though never for longer than the uncertainty interval, nor more
than once per node.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the contrast between Spanner and <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> is that
Spanner always waits on writes for a short interval, whereas <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev>
sometimes waits on reads for a longer interval. How long is that interval?
Well, it depends on how clocks on <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> nodes are being synchronized.
Using <abbrev>NTP</abbrev>, it could very well be up to 250ms. Not great, but the kind of
transaction that would restart for the full interval would have to be reading
constantly updated values across many nodes. These kinds of patterns do exist
in practice, but are the exception.</p>

<p>Because <abbrev>CRDB</abbrev> relies on clock synchronization, nodes periodically compare
clock offsets amongst themselves. If the configured maximum offset is exceeded
by any node, it self-terminates. If you’re curious about what happens when
maximum clock offsets are violated, we’ve thought about it a bit
<a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/operational-faqs.html#what-happens-when-node-clocks-are-not-properly-synchronized">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="8-concluding-thoughts">8. Concluding thoughts</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, thanks for hanging in there. If you&rsquo;re new to it
all, this is tricky stuff to grok. Even we occasionally need reminding about
how it all fits together, and we built the damn thing.</p>
