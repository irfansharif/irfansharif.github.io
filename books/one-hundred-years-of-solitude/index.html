    <h2>One Hundred Years of Solitude</h2>
  
  
    <p class="single-time"><time>September 10, 2020</time></p>
  

  <p>Pretty unique book. The story telling here is very non-linear for one; the
timeline is more like a <em>map</em> in that the past, present, and future are all
observed at the same time. It opens with the snippet below, and the mode
permeates throughout.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>
Many years later, as he faced the
firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buend√≠a was to remember that distant afternoon
when his father took him to discover ice, [...]
</em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s also very cyclical. The story is about seven generations of Arcadio
family, where the same names (and just as confusingly, characteristics and
misfortunes) are shared across the many generations. It can make for a somewhat
dense read, but it works well as a story telling device. It&rsquo;s also imbued with
magical realism &ndash; you&rsquo;re reading the account of a remote village with limited
interaction with the outside world (hence the title), and everything is colored
through that lens. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p>This was my first book from a Latin American author, and it&rsquo;s readily apparent
how different that is compared to what I&rsquo;m otherwise used to. A lot of the
themes in the book draw from Latin American history and politik, that alone
made it worthwhile. It does take some time to go through the whole thing, I had
abandoned it last year and had to start over from scratch because it would&rsquo;ve
been too confusing otherwise (but I&rsquo;m glad I did).</p>
